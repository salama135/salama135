## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me ##

### Bio ###
* I'm a software engineer that has attention to detail. 
* I like to be organized at work and with my life. 
* I always strive for perfection or as close as i can get to it.
* I like to be labelled as a generalist as i feel a software engineer shouldn't just be a "coder" in a certain stack but he should be a programmer with all stacks and fields be in his grasp. 
* These words are just what i strive to be everyday.
